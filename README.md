# GetReportXMLorJSON
MicroStrategy plugin that enables users to return report results as XML or JSON.

This plugin is similar to the OOTB reportDataExecute task, however, this plugin works with reports that have a page-by.

The out of the box reportDataExecute task does not support reports that have a page-by.
